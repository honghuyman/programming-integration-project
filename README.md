### Setting up Dev

#### Client

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `/client` in VSCode or your favorite IDE
3. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Install dependencies for server
    ```
    cd ../server
    npm install
    cd ../client
    ```

4. Start developing
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    Note: The start script will run both the server and the client at the same time, so you don't need to run the server again to use API.
